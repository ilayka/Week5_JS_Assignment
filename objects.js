Task 1: Gamer Profile Manager 🎮 🎮 🎮 🎮

You are creating a system to manage a gamer's profile. 

Steps:
1. Create an object named `gamerProfile` with the following properties:
   - `username` (string): The gamer's username.
   - `level` (number): The gamer's level.
   - `isOnline` (boolean): Whether the gamer is currently online.

2. Write a function `updateOnlineStatus` that:
   - Takes the `gamerProfile` object and a boolean `status` as arguments.
   - Updates the `isOnline` property based on the `status`.
   - Logs: "[username] is now online." or "[username] is now offline."

Example:
Input:
const gamerProfile = {
  username: "ShadowSlayer",
  level: 5,
  isOnline: false
};

updateOnlineStatus(gamerProfile, true);

Expected Output:
"ShadowSlayer is now online."
